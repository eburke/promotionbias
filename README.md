# Promotion Bias
Inspired by [Male-female differences: A computer simulation] [1], this Java app simulates how gender bias results in larger than expected disparity at the top levels of an organization.

# Running the Code
Load it up in your IDE of choice and run the `main` method in the `bias.Simulation` class.

# How it Works

The simulation starts with an 8-level organization with a pyramid structure, in which there are fewer positions as you move toward the top. There are 500 entry level positions, 350 at the next level up, on up to only 10 positions at the "executive" level.
